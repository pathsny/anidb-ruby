# ANIDB RUBY

This is a very simple anidb client, made mostly for my needs. It's been built by scavenging a much more featurefull client that you can find here http://www.lacave.net/~fred/projets/ranidb/.

# RENAMER

This is a script that when run, scans all the files in a folder

* renames them with any custom pattern you would like
* builds symlinks to allow you to identify series, movies etc
* adds them files to your anidb myslist
* generates nfo files for xbmc integration
* generates id files for plex integration

Run this using ```bundle exec ruby script/post_process.rb```


# INSTALLATION

* Install ruby
* download this repository using git or by downloading the archive.
* run scripts/setup.rb
* modify data/options.yml to add your username and other details

# OTHER SCRIPTS
There is another top level script called nfoize. This is to create nfo files in your anime folders for XBMC. To run this just say "ruby nfoize.rb <anime_folder> <location to keep the processed folders>".  The script assumes that in the anime folder you have one folder per anime and each of these has files. It uses the anidb api, so you'll have to edit the options.yml
